                      <div  style="text-indent: 20px; color: darkblue;">Code.org is a non-profit organization and eponymous website led by Hadi and Ali Partovi
                           that aims to encourage people, particularly school students in the United States, to 
                           learn computer science. The website includes free coding lessons and the initiative 
                           also targets schools in an attempt to encourage them to include more computer science 
                           classes in the curriculum. On December 9, 2013, they launched the Hour of Code 
                           nationwide to promote computer science during Computer Science Education Week through 
                           December 15, 2013.

                      <div  style="text-indent: 20px; color: darkblue;">During Computer Science Education Week  from December 9 to December 15, 2013, 
                          Code.org launched the "Hour of Code Challenge" on its website to teach computer 
                          science to school students, enticing them to complete short programming tutorials. 
                          The Hour of Code involved getting people to write short snippets of code to 
                          achieve pre-specified goals using Blockly, a visual programming language of a 
                          similar flavor as Logo. The initiative had been announced about two months in 
                          advance and at the time of launch, the initiative was supported by former United 
                          States President Barack Obama as well as executives from technology companies 
                          such as Microsoft and Apple Inc. It was also supported by educational online 
                          learning platforms such as Khan Academy. About 20 million people participated 
                          and over 600 million lines of code had been written. The Hour of Code also offered 
                          participation gifts to some of the schools involved, such as a set of fifty laptops 
                          or a conference call with one a tech "luminary" like Gates or Dorsey. The crowdfunding 
                          effort for Hour of Code received the highest amount of funding ever raised on Indiegogo. 
                          By October 2014, about forty million students had taken the Hour of Code class, 
                          and a second Hour of Code was held in December 2014. That year, locations for 
                          Hour of Code lessons included Apple retail stores.

                      <div>
                          <div style="text-indent: 20px; color: darkblue;">Every year in December, classes can join millions of students around the world celebrating 
                          Computer Science Education Week with the Hour of Code. Despite the difficulties of the pandemic, 
                          we also wanted to organize Hour of Code project virtually. Firstly, we, four students from 
                          ADA University, started to searching about what is Code org. Then we decided to choose 8th 
                          grade class of Secondary School No.197 named after Elman Heydarov Korgoz (Garadagh). We chose 
                          specific time which is 6th of December at 03:00PM and created a session for this time.</div><br>

                        <div style="text-indent: 20px; color: darkblue;">We started the lesson by introducing ourselves. After the presentation, we informed the students 
                        about the educational life at ADA University, specialties, partner universities, discounts, job 
                        opportunities. We provided information about the history of the Code.org project, its creators, its 
                        contributions to students, and the language choices they have created so that students do not have 
                        difficulty. Then we taught the students about the tasks in the "Hour of Code" project. Then we 
                        announced that they will receive a certificate after completing the course. At the end of the 
                        lesson, some students asked questions related to "Computer Science, IT and Computer Engineering".</div><br>

                        <div style="text-indent: 20px; color: darkblue;">In conclusion, except the highlighted deficit of online session, everything was superb and we had 
                         such a productive and fruitful result by the end of the course. On the other hand,  we had a record 
                         of the lesson when we look throw the recording we understood how teaching can be hard and fun at the 
                         same time and after editing that we put it to the youtube. The first teaching day in our life was 
                         successful for both students and for us. Teaching the bases of coding to the students was fun. 
                         And we believe that there will be, definitely, futureâ€™s specialist among them.</div><br>
